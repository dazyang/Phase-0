                              <p><strong>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</strong>
                                  <br>
                                  1. Got blocked on a simple problem<br>
                                  2. Solved a problem in an elegant way
                              </p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>What was the problem?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">This particular problem I remember from sprint-3 was when trying to make my website responsive. In the mobile version of my website, I wanted to have my navigation bar to become shorter and place on top of the contents; the navigation bar is set to three-columns wide (based on a twelve-columns grids) and stays on the left side of the webpage in desktop version, and blog contents on the right. When the screen size reduces, I wanted the blog contents to go beneath the navigation bar. I went through a lot of trials and errors before getting to act right. </p>

                                  <li>What problem solving techniques did you use?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">A lot of trying and googling but none worked. I met some of the people from my cohort that week at EDA, so I took the chance to ask for help from my peers. The problem was solved straightaway and helped me understand why my previous trials don’t work. </p>

                                  <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">At first, I felt frustrated that I couldn’t figure the problem. Then, I realised if I had asked for help much earlier, it would’ve saved me a lot time and to realise my blindspots. </p>

                                  <li>What did you learn?</li>

                                    <p class="answer"><strong>Don’t be stubborn.</strong> Ask for help when you are really stuck.  </p>
                              </ul>

                              <strong>Reflect</strong> on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
                              <br>
                              <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong></li>
                                  <p class="answer">I’m not very confident with using pseudocode yet.</p>
                                <li><strong>Trying something</strong> </li>
                                <p class="answer"> Relatively comfortable on trying something, although most of the time it didn’t work. </p>
                                <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></li> <p class="answer">Not at all confident, in fact, I have forgotten what this method is about. I’ll need to go back to refresh my memory on this one.<p>
                                <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong> </li> <p class="answer"> Relatively competent. </li>
                                <li><strong>Console.logging</strong> </li> <p class="answer"> I need to get more familiar with console.logging</p>
                                <li><strong>Googling</strong> </li> <p class="answer"> My usual method.</p>
                                <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> </li> <p class="answer"> Sometimes I forgot or feel a bit shy to ask for help on Slack channel, but I’ve grown to get comfortable with it over the last couple of weeks.</p>
                                <li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> </li> <p class="answer"> So far I haven’t ask for help from a coach, for the same reason stated above. </p>
                                <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> </li>
                                <p class="answer"> Yes, reflection on learning has been very helpful. </p>
                              </ul>
                              </p>

                              <p><strong>Explain to your non-tech friend</strong><br>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words below: (These aren't my words.)</p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>.map()</li>
                                    <p class="answer">The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.</p>
                                  <li>.filter()</li>
                                    <p class="answer">The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).</p>
                                  <li>.reduce()</li>
                                    <p class="answer">The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.</p>
                              </ul>
