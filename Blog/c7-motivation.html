                              <p><strong>Reflect on this week's reading</strong></p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>How does life look through the'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">My ideal future would be to have my own small creative firm that provides services for educational purposes that helps to create a better and fairer society. Be it to raise awareness of a certain issue, or creating educational programmes for clients as such, and keep growing from there.</p>

                                  <li>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise: 1) What are your core values? 2) What do you stand for?</li>

                                  <p class="answer">Equality, compassion and empathy.</p>

                                  <li>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</li>

                                  <p class="answer">Really great. It's a great reminder that, we are so used to reading 'successful stories' on the media that we tend to forget the amount of trial and error phase 'this successful story' must had gone through before it reachs its peak. And just because you have reached a peak, it doesn't mean the errors will stop there. For a story to grow, there lies many more chanllenges which mean more trial and errors lies ahead to overcoming those hurdles, before reaching next height. Optimism is an important survival skill (but not blind optimism) to keep one going.</p>
