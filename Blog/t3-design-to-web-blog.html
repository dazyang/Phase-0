                              <p><strong>Discuss the following question to a lay person:</strong></p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">The ever increasing number of web devices has introduced new viewing experiences to the users. Even though, desktop web viewing is still in the majority, the number of people going on internet by using their mobile or tablet devices is on the rise steadily. Therefore, the need for designers and web developers to create websites that adapts to different electronic devices is on demand; a website that designed for desktop viewing only won’t work for viewing on a mobile devices given that they are different in screen resolution and its user experiences. Responsive website design adapts to different viewing devices by using flexible grid concept and media queries to ensure the content of the website are rearranged proportionally to remain functional. </p>

                                  <li>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">Mobile first design, as the name itself suggested, is a (website) design that is considered for mobile viewing first instead of desktop viewing first. Unlike desktop first design that often waters down the content of the website and its functionality when scaling down to display on a mobile device; the concept of mobile first design weighs on the idea of ‘progressive enhancement’ which takes the route of making the website more rich and robust in its content and functionality.</p>

                                  <li>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</li>

                                    <p class="answer">Frameworks are like ready-made code templates that provides a set structure for the website. They are powerful and convenient tools to use which can save a lot of time for the developers. It helps to speed up the mock-up processes and provide solutions to common CSS problems, and browser compatibility. </p>

                                  <li>What a wireframe is a why we use it?</li>
