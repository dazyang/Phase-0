      <h2>Based on the video discuss:</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
          <p>It sounds like EDA provides an open learning envrioment that works more like a thinktank group in a way. People work towards a common goal to help and challenge each other in a positive way.   </p>
          <li>What are your impressions?</li>
          <p> It sounds like EDA encourages students to bring their ideas to the table and to help each other achieve better results. </p>
          <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
          <p>I have a good feeling about this, yet I know I'll constantly be worrying about slowing other people down in a group project situation. Particularly because English is my second language, so I'm not very good in participting in group discuss. </p>
          <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
          <p>Not really, it's been pretty consistant.</p>
          <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
          <p>Yes to both! But I'll try not to let my fear to get the best of me.</p>
