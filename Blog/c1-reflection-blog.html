      <div class="section_title"><b>Based on the video discuss the questions below:</b></div>
      <div class="Q_A">What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
          <p>It sounds like EDA provides an open learning envrioment that works more like a thinktank group in a way. People work towards a common goal to help and challenge each other in a positive way.</p></div>
          <div class="Q_A">What are your impressions?
          <p> It sounds like EDA encourages students to bring their ideas to the table and to help each other achieve better results.</p></div>
          <div class="Q_A">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
          <p>I have a good feeling about this, yet I know I'll constantly be worrying about slowing other people down in a group project situation. Particularly because English is my second language, so I'm not very good in participting in group discuss. </p></div>
          <div class="Q_A">Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
          <p>Not really, it's been pretty consistant.</p></div>
          <div class="Q_A">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
          <p>Yes to both! But I'll try not to let my fear to get the best of me.</p></div>
