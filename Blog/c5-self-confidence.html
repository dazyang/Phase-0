                              <p><strong>Reflect on this week's reading - Chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself</strong></p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">The relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness is like a poll holding a flag, as described in the chapter. When one began to become aware of one is being engulfed in a terrible emotional mind-storm; mindfulness is a tool to use to ground oneself in order to survive in that mind-storm and not be blown away (as in totally give into that negative emotion).</p>

                                  <li>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">I was taught that Body Scan helps with sleeping problem, so I've tried this technique regularly. It does help when I'm able to stay focused in the zone. I'd really like to try to get into the habit of Journalling, I totally agree with how writing helps release stress and how it affects our brain. I haven't try the specific practice yet, but I know I sometimes find writing rather theraputic (although sometimes can be a stressful task too).</p>

                                  <li>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">I agree with that and I really liked the way he describes that the emotions we experience are like clouds in the sky that comes and goes. How we talk to ourselve (and to others) is very important to our well-being.</p>
