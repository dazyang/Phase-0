        <div class="Q_A">Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
                    <p>HTML is the langauge that is used to lay the fundation of a website. It determines where the contents of the website goes and get housed into - breaks the structure of a website into HTML elements. CSS works together with HTML file to control the look of each HTML elements, it defines the visual presentation of the website. DOM renders a HTML file and organise it into a tree structure - it defines the logical structure of a website.</p>

        <div class ="Q_A">What is meant by boxifying design?
            <p>It means breaks the graphic design of the website into seperate boxes – as all HTML elements are considered as boxes – to determine how to lay them out in HTML.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
        <div class ="Q_A">What is the box model?
            <p>A box model in web design is made of margins, borders, padding and content. With content being the centre element; padding is the space around the content and border goes around both. Margin is the space sitting outside of the border.</p>
