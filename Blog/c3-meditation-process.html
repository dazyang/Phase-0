                              <p><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong><br>I must admit I forgot to keep the concept in mind during the course of redesigning the website. I spent way too long fixating on trying to get my site to look exactly the way I want it to be, and later realised it didn’t really help me achieving much on my project during those time spent – and now I’m still not happy with my website... So, I failed the ‘process over product’ concept in this case. </p>

                              <p><strong>Reflection on Chapter 2 of Search inside yourself:</strong></p>

                              <ul>
                                  <li>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">Over the last three years or so, I’ve been trying to practice meditation from time to time but never really ‘succeed’. I drift off easily and only find myself to give up on the idea after a minute or two. However, I did also tried those meditation apps before and found having a voice guidance is somewhat helpful to stay focused.</p>

                                  <li>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">The new things I learnt from reading Search Inside Yourself are those scientific results that shows how meditation can strengthen the part of our brain that associated with positive emotions. I find a lot of encouragement in reading these results.</p>

                                  <li>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</li>

                                    <p class="answer">I liked how it compared practising meditation to gym workouts; that regain attentional focus is like ‘flexing your biceps during your gym workout’-  everytime you are bringing your attention back to breathing you are evidently exercising those mental muscles. This actually makes me feel okay about drifting and instead of giving up as I normal would, now I try to stay and to regain that attentional focus. </p>

                                  <li>Any other musings?</li>
